A project manager for YGOPro extension packs.

## Overview

This is an open source tool written in Lua, using LuaJIT, to help Yu-Gi-Oh! card makers
for the YGOPro game. It helps the process of managing extension packs: copying files to
the game folder, adding cards to the extension database, generating card pics, etc.

The name of the project is based on the Portuguese word for factory, _f√°brica_, and is
pronounced just like that, "FAH-bree-kah". From Brazil, with love :green_heart:.

## Features

future are left unchecked.

## Installation

### Linux

Install the following software in their latest versions:
- LuaJIT ([download](http://luajit.org/download.html), unzip and install with
`$ make && sudo make install`)
- libvips ([download](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases), unzip, install with
`$ ./configure`, then `$ make && sudo make install`)

_Note: you can find more details about installation browsing the links._

Then, download the [latest release](https://github.com/piface314/ygo-fabrica/releases) of
YGOFabrica and unzip it anywhere.

Run `make.lua` with `luajit`. You can `chmod` that file to run it directly or specify
`luajit`. Like this:
```
$ sudo ./make.lua install
```
OR
```
$ sudo luajit ./make.lua install
```

If there are no errors, you're ready to go!

This will install YGOFabrica to `/usr/local/ygofab` and place two links in
`/usr/local/bin` (`ygofab` and `ygopic`) as this is probably already in your `PATH`
(add it if it's not there).

You can change the install location by giving `install.lua` a path, like:
```
$ sudo ./make.lua install path/to/your/folder
```

In case you have any problems using the program, you can delete the `build` folder from
the unzipped files and build the dependencies from scratch. (You must have
[LuaRocks](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Download) installed and configured
for Lua5.1/LuaJIT for this to work):
```
$ ./make.lua build
```
