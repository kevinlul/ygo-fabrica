# YGOFabrica

A project manager for YGOPro extension packs.

## Overview

This is an open source tool written in Lua, using LuaJIT, to help Yu-Gi-Oh! card makers
for the YGOPro game. It helps the process of managing extension packs: copying files to
the game folder, adding cards to the extension database, generating card pics, etc.

The name of the project is based on the Portuguese word for factory, _f√°brica_, and is
pronounced just like that, "FAH-bri-ka". From Brazil, with love :green_heart:.
