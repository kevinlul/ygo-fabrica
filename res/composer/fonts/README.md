### Note

This folder is supposed to keep font files that are used by the Composer module, that
generates card pics from your extension pack data. However, the official fonts may not be
free, and thus cannot be published in this repository. The only exception is the font
used in Link Rating as I made it myself, so it's already here.

If you're already on YGOPro Percy Discord server, you can find me there (PiFace) and
ask me the fonts.

After getting the fonts, and before installing the program, copy them to this folder.
